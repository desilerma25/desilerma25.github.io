The age old question rings through, why did you choose this field? Well, to be quite honest, I did not originally aspire to become a Software Engineer growing up. As time has passed, I've gone through a variety of job titles, such as Cosmetologist, Office Specialist, Administrative Support, and Legal Assistant. None of these supplied enough creativity and challenge to keep me happy. Then, I came across a few YouTube videos discussing bootcamps and people who made complete career changes and discovered a love for coding. I progressivley became more and more interested! I watched more videos, I researched the best bootcamps, and practiced coding whenever I could. In doing all of these things, I discovered a passion for Software Engineering I didn't even know I had within me. Sofware Engineering allows me to be challenged and problem solve as well be creative. Software Engineering is a whole different animal that I cannot wait to tackle. I love that the enviorment is an ever evolving one. I never wish to know it all; I wish to constantly learn new and adapt to new changes. Software Engineering gives me all of that. I am excited for my future as a Software Engineer.
